               within the next few years. <br> <br>
              The NIST Foundation was initiated by a group of scientists and academicians. 
              The core objectives were to establish academic institutions, and to provide students with quality 
              education focusing primarily on science and technology, so as to promote the science education in the 
              country. At present, there are nine academic institutions including the National School of Sciences 
              under the NIST Foundation, and they run classes from Pre–school to university level at different 
              locations. The school has always emphasized the academic excellence of students and fostered a culture 
              of innovation and collaboration.  <br> <br> As a result, our students graduate with outstanding performance in the 
              board examinations every year. Today, many of its alumni are engaged in the highly regarded professions 
              and businesses within the country and abroad. The school enrolls 2,000 students annually, in the Science 
              and Management Stream. The students are drawn from different states, diverse culture and ethnicity allowing 
              them to engage in intercultural understanding and to experience a rich learning. The school provides students 
              with ample opportunities to engage in co–curricular and extra–curricular activities such as community service, 
              and leadership programmes that ensure their holistic development which enables them to succeed not only in higher
               education but in life as well. <br> <br> In addition, the school aspires to instill in students the moral values such as 
               integrity, responsibility, empathy, collaboration and respect that are essential for students to be a good human 
               being while providing them with a caring, safe and supportive environment to learn thereby nature their potential.

          <h3> Message from the Chairman</h3>
          <p>The National School of Sciences (NSS) is a premier education institute managed by the NIST Foundation 
            that was established nearly three decades ago. The core objectives of the foundation, as an apex body,
             have been to establish education institutions, and provide students academic programmes from pre–school
              to high school to university. Today, there are nine academic institutions under the NIST Foundation 
              across the Valley, and they offer different academic programmes such as Science, Management, IT, 
              Pharmacy, Food Technology, Microbiology among others. I attribute the success of the institutions to the hard work, dedication and commitment of our teachers, 
              admin staff and leadership team and trust and support of parents, students and other stakeholders.</p>

          <h3>Why Educational Institute?</h3> <br>
          <p>Located at the heart of the capital city, Kathmandu and easily accessible because of the extensive network of public transport, National School of Sciences, popularly known as NIST–NSS has been at the helm of Upper Secondary school education (earlier known as Plus 2) in Nepal for nearly three decades. Started with a total of 157 students in the Science stream only, the National School of Sciences has come a long way. The annual intake in the
             school hovers around two thousand students for Grade 11 Science and Management programme.Through all these years of providing academic service for aspiring students, the National School of Sciences has rightfully carved a niche for itself, 
             and is acknowledged for providing quality education within an affordable fee structure. </p>
