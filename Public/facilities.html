				<h3>Teaching in montessori based in pre-primary level</h3>
				<p> The Montessori method of teaching is a modern educational movement that encourages teachers to view 
					children and classroom education differently than the common teacher-student relationship. 
					Montessori developed and devised special techniques and materials which aid in the 
					development of the child’s entire being. The Pre-Primary Montessori classroom is 
					devised in such a manner that it promotes 3, 4, & 5 year olds (which includes Kindergarten 
					age children) the ability to coexist and work harmoniously in a combined settting that allows 
					for individual differences. The Montessori method is most often applied at the pre-school level
				due to its focus on early child development.  </p>

						<h2>Deposition of Mobile Phones</h2>
						<p>In the technology driven era we live in, it would be a fallacy to completely ban the bringing of smartphones to school. However, there is a very thin line between the use and misuse of smartphones by a student. Therefore, to avoid any unpleasant situation, students are required to deposit their smartphones in pigeonholes for safekeeping. Smartphones are strictly prohibited from being taken to the classroom, and if found on person inside the classroom, irrespective of it being used or not, the mobile phone will be confiscated till the end of the academic session. Students are provided tokens for the deposited smartphone which will be reclaimed after all the classes are complete for the day.</p>
